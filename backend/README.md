## Naming convention

Use clear but comprehensive examples. For instance, for Java method name use something like getStudent which is multi-word to better represent the camelCase factor.

Methods  : camelCase e.g getStudent(), getSchool etc
Classes  : PascalCase e.g Student{}, School{}, etc
Constants variables : SNAKE_CASE e.g  final String STUDENT_NOT_FOUND = "Student with id %d not found"; 
instance/static variables : camelCase e.g private String requirementsService;
